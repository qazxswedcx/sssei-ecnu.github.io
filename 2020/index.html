            <hr>
            <P>Initiated by Prof. Jifeng He (Academician of CAS, the founder of The Software Engineering Institute of ECNU),
                SEI-ECNU Summer School has been an annual event since 2005, aiming to provide a platform for graduate students
                and young researchers in computer science or software engineering to learn state-of-the-art techniques in related fields.
                It also aims to strengthen communication between Chinese researchers and leading global research groups in Software Engineering.
                It is freely accessible to students from all over China with a specific theme each year.
            </P>
            <p>In 2020, the SEI summer school is themed as “Formal Methods for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence”.
                The bloom of AI techniques in the past has raised various new scientific challenges such as the correctness,
                reliability and explainability of AI-based software systems. The issue is particularly vital to those AI embedded safety-critical systems
                such as self-driving and clinical diagnosis. Formal methods, as a traditional means to reliability guarantee, are potential solutions to the challenges.

            <li><STRONG>Software Abstractions and Human-Cyber-Physical Systems Architecture Modelling （Prof. Zhiming LIU）</STRONG></li>
            <p>
                Human-Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS) is a combination of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) with ubiquitous computing (also known as intelligent environment)
                and social systems, including social computing. In HCPS, humans as individuals or unorganized and organized crowds deeply involved in interactions with physical
                and cyber systems, and operation and control of physical processes and hardware dynamically shift between humans and machines. The theory and methods of HCPS is still in its infancy,
                and research is needed to establish its scientific foundation so as to make advances in its engineering methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this short course, we reflect the development of software engineering through software abstractions and show that these abstractions are integral in the notion of software system architectures.
                We discuss that it is important to engineer systems using formal methods in relation to the definition and management of development processes,
                and argue how a model of the software architecture, with rich semantics and refinement relations, plays an important role in this process.
                We recall the traditional separation of processes for domain modelling and software requirements modelling in model-driven software development.
                We then propose to combine these modelling approaches and this naturally leads to a unified process for HCPS architecture modelling, design, and evolution.
                Based on the unified processes, we outline a framework in engineering formal methods for HCPS modelling, with the discussion about significant challenges
                including integration, composition, collaboration, verification of HCPS with multi-dimensional heterogeneity. Human components, as well as all kinds of artificial intelligent systems, are particularly major courses of the heterogeneity.

            <li><STRONG>Formal Verification of Deep Neural Networks (Prof. Guy Katz)</STRONG></li>
            <p>
                Deep neural networks have emerged as a widely used and effective means for tackling complex, real-world problems.
                However, a major obstacle in incorporating them as controllers in safety-critical systems is the great difficulty in providing formal guarantees about their behavior.
                In recent years, attempts have been made to address this obstacle by formally verifying neural networks. However, neural network verification is a computationally difficult task,
                and traditional verification techniques have often had only limited success - leading to the development of novel techniques. In this series of talks we will survey the state of the art in neural network verification,
                focusing on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) based approaches and on abstraction/refinement based methods. Additionally, we will survey recent advances in the verification of recurrent neural networks.
                Finally, we will discuss the applicability of neural network verification, going over examples that include airborne collision avoidance, neural network simplification, and the verification of rate control algorithms.

                <DD>- The polyhedral model and its use to generate parallel programs and hardware accelerators</DD>
                <DD>- Prof. Patrice Quinton</DD>
                <DD>- Generating efficient parallel programs is nowadays a major objective for computer science, with the availability of current multi- or many-core processors. </DD>
                <DD>- Generating parallel hardware accelerators is also an important challenge, in order to take advantage of available IC technologies, among which FPGAs. The polyhedral model is a way of representing regular computations, such as loops for example, so that parallelization transformations can be expressed by means of formal mathematical manipulations. In this model, calculations are represented as integral points belonging to convex polyhedra, and parallelization transformations amount to apply functions to polyhedra. Alternatively, one can use the same model to represent parallel hardware synthesis. We present an introduction to the polyhedral model and to its use for the generation of parallel program and for hardware synthesis, and we illustrate this introduction with various application examples.</DD>
                <DD>- Synchronous model of time</DD>
                <DD>- Prof.  Marc Pouzet</DD>
                <DD>- Synchronous languages have been introduced in the 80's for programming embedded control software. The purpose was to allow the designer to model control-systems in a high-level language  built on a mathematically precise semantics, and to associate it with static analysis and code generation mechanism insuring that the target code is equivalent to the source model. All these language share the "synchronous model of time", namely that computations can be neglected at modeling time because the compiler is able to generate target code which is proved to run in bounded time and space.  The success of the original synchronous languages has spurred the development of new languages, based on the same principles, that increase modularity, expressiveness and that address new applications like real-time video streaming, latency-insensitive designs, large scale simulations, hybrid (continuous/discrete) systems.</DD>
                <DD>- Lucid Synchrone is one of these new languages. It has served as a basis for experiment with several novel extensions including, higher-order functions, type systems for the clock calculus, hierarchical state machines with shared variables, signals and new compilation methods.
                    Many of these ideas have been adopted in commercial tools, notably SCADE 6. New topics include techniques for allowing bounded desynchronisation through buffers (N-synchrony) and extensions for modeling continuous systems.

                <DD>- LogicalTime @ Work: The Clock Constraint Specification Language</DD>
                <DD>- Prof. Frédéric Mallet</DD>
                <DD>- Logical Time is an elastic form of time made popular concurrently by synchronous languages and by Lamport's work on logical clocks for distributed systems. The Clock Constraint Specification Language gives a concrete syntax to build logical time specifications that work both at the application level, to capture causal relationships and data dependencies without restraining the potential concurrency, and at the execution platform level, to capture the relative parallelism of the multi-core architectures. The elasticity is key to adapt and progressively refine one onto the other. This lecture gives an overview of CCSL, its origins and its relationships to engineering models. It also goes over the main issues of CCSL clock calculus and of some of the results available for the verification of CCSL specifications. After introducing the concepts, a lab is proposed to use CCSL with its dedicated tool <a href="http://timesquare.inria.fr">TimeSquare</a>.
                    The lecture also serves as an introduction to a second lecture (by Julien DeAntoni) on the use of CCSL for the orchestration and execution of heterogeneous models.

                <DD>- Static analysis by abstract interpretation</DD>
                <DD>- Prof. Xavier Rival</DD>
                <DD>- In this lecture, we will show the main principles of static analysis by abstract interpretation. Static analysis aims at inferring non trivial semantic properties of programs. As all nontrivial semantic properties are not decidable, there is no hope for a full general and automatic solution to this problem. We will present the main techniques that allow to partially attack this problem, and during the rest of the lecture, we will focus on static analysis by abstract interpretation. We will give the fundamental definitions required to understand how to design a simple static analysis. In the last part of the lecture, we will demonstrate the use of a static analysis tool in a lab session.</DD>
